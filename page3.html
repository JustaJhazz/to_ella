    <div id="poem"><p>

        You are the rose, both fierce and fair,<br>
        With petals soft beyond compare.<br>
        You bloom with grace, so wild, so free,<br>
        A beauty rare, a sight to see.<br>
        <br>
        Yet thorns you wear, sharp, proud, and true,<br>
        A warning whispered in the dew.<br>
        For love that dares to hold you tight,<br>
        Must face the sting, must brave the fight.<br>
        <br>
        And though your touch may sometimes pain,<br>
        I'd walk through fire, I'd bear the rain.<br>
        For every thorn, a lesson learned,<br>
        And every wound, a love returned.<br>
        <br>
        So here I stand, unshaken still,<br>
        I'll always love youâ€”I always do and always will</p></div>
